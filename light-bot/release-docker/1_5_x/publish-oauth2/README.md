### The purpose of this config

The config files in this folder are used to re-publish the light-oauth2 images to docker hub. It happens after a patch is applied to modules of light-oauth2 and you want to publish to docker hub only without generating
changelog and update github.com for a new release. The release version should be the same as this is only a patch and there is no impact for people who are using it. It is also a template to publish a patch for other docker image.

### Prepare the environment
