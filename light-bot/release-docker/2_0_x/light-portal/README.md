### The purpose of this config

The config files in this folder are used to build and publish all the docker images for the light-portal. As the project is not open sourced, there is no need to publish any release information to the github or git.lightapi.net sites.

### Prepare the environment

If this is your first time to use light-bot, then you need to clone both light-bot and light-config-test repository to a workspace and follow the instructions below to build light-bot.
