## Purpose:

The config files in this folder are for [eventuate todo-list example](https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/eventuate/todo-list)
and there is a [tutorial](https://www.networknt.com/tutorial/eventuate/todo-list/)
with detailed steps.


Services built on top of light-eventuate-4j need infrastructure services to
run. You can install Kafka, Zookeeper, Mysql and CDC server on your local
with docker-compose which is documented in [getting started](https://www.networknt.com/tutorial/eventuate/getting-started/)
or you can use our cloud services which is very convenient for individual
developers or for developers who cannot use docker-compose.
