### The final configuration has been moved to the taiji-chain/light-config-test due to security reason.


This is the folder that contains the docker-compose files to start the light-portal hybrid-query and hybrid-command servers on the test cloud.

There are four servers that will be involved for query0, query1, query2 and command.

test1, test2, test3 and portal.
